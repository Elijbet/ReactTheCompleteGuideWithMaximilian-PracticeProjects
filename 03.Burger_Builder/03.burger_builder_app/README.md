## Project Roadmap

* Setup the project with eject option for open configuration, so we can enable the CSS modules.
* Project tree.
* Setup Aux functional component so we can wrap multiple tags in it instead of using an enclosing div.
* Build ingredient case function and prop-type validation.
* Get the Burger Ingredients to show up.
